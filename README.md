# Remote Observation Robot

![Robot](/robot.jpg)

## Project description

This project presents a remote observation robot that was designed and built by me from scratch in 2018. This robot allows the user to conduct remote observations in hard-to-reach places, which is particularly useful in applications such as exploration of uninhabited areas, industrial inspections or environmental monitoring.

## Functions

### 1. HD camera

The robot is equipped with an HD camera that allows you to obtain high-quality images and recordings in real time. The user can conveniently view the image from the camera on their device.

### 2. Remote Control

The robot is remotely controlled using a dedicated application or web interface. Thanks to this, the user can control the robot's movement and camera orientation.

### 3. Systems 

- 2 x Arduino (Arduino Uno in my case)
- Wifi Camera
- Transmitter and receiver modules
- Motors and wheels for movement
- Distance sensors
- Battery or power source
- Computer or mobile device for remote control

### 4. Source Files

Source files allow you to recreate the robot using programs such as: Arduino IDE, 123D Design Autocad, EAGLE, Eclipse.
